# Chicken Little

-- Insert Logo --

  <p align="center">
    Our game title named Chicken little is inspired from how we humans always refer to it as a person that fear something.
    Cliche: What are you? Chicken? (means pussy!) 
    Player: Chicken
    Put in things that people fear? That the chicken is running away from.
